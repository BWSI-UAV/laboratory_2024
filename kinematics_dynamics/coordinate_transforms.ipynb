    "## ROS tf2 Library\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems we have attempted to address in this module (i.e. managing multiple reference frames) are by no means unique to quadrotors and we are not the first people to write functions to solve such problems. The functionality of managing different reference frames is ubiquitous throughout robotics, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, computer graphics, etc. and many libraries have been written for handling such functionality. When working with ROS, the most important of such libraries is the [tf (now tf2) library](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2). While we have access to this library on the drone, we have not made use of it here because it obscures some of the underlying mathematics that we hope for you to learn and it requires additional setup steps when defining new frames that we don't intend to teach. If you are curious to know more about how ROS manages large numbers of reference frames simultaneously, we encourage you to read up more on `tf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE:__ `tf` in the context of ROS should not be confused with TensorFlow which is often abbreviated as tf in code. These libraries have completely different purposes."
