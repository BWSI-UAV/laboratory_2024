### Please answer the following questions and push your answers to your team's remote documents repository

For true/false question, if the statement is false, provide a description of why it is false.

- What are some of the difference between the a research and development drone vs other "commercial" or "toy" drones?
- What are some current applications of autonomous drones? Can you think of any future applications as technology improves (e.g. faster, smaller, more efficient computers)?
- Describe the difference between the Compute Board and Flight Controller. What purposes do each serve? What operating systems do each run?
- Which communication architecture are we using to connect are computers to the drone: Peer2Peer or centralized? What about the remote control - drone communication?
- True or False: For manual flight control, the remote control communicates with the drone over wifi.
- In order to know where the drone is in the world, it needs some form of positioning sensor/algorithms, otherwise it would be flying blind. What are the different types of positioning sensors available? Which do you think we are going to use during the class?
- True or False: during our indoor flights, we can use the GPS sensor to estimate the drone's position in the world.
- Are optical flow algorithms responsible for mapping the environment? If not, can you describe conceptually what optical flow does?
- Which potential sensors on a Drone enables 3D visual mapping? 
- How does the Compute Board communicate with the Flight Controller? 
- What is PX4 and where is it running on the drone? 
- Which of these best describes MAVLink: 1. an operating system used on the drone, 2. a sensor on the drone, 3. a communication protocol on the drone, 4. a programming language
- If I want to write a new, complex computer vision algorithm for the drone, should I add it to the Flight Controller firmware? if not, where should I add it and why?
