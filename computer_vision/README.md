This directory contains practicals and solutions for the computer vision module of the class.
Note that this work is actively hosted in Mark Mazumder's MIT GitHub account repo here: https://github.mit.edu/ma23705/bwsi_camera_experiments. This directory is more of a centralized archive for future classes.

Further note, the notebooks are assumed to be running on a AWS server, thus calls to the `ganymede` library.
This will likely have unintended behavior if run localy on a single machine. Discuss with Mark Mazumder to resolve
